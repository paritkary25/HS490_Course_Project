\section{Introduction to National Culture}
\subsection{What is Culture?}
\begin{quote}
    Culture is collective programming of the mind which distuinguishes the member of one social group from another.\hfill -Greet Hofstede
\end{quote}

Culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a particular group or society. It includs every aspect of the society be it food, music, religion. The culture can be learned and is passed on generation by generation.

One common theory is that culture developed as a way for early humans to adapt to their environments and survive in challenging conditions. For example, the development of agriculture and animal domestication allowed early humans to settle in one place and build complex societies, which in turn led to the development of language, art, religion, and other cultural practices. Hence group of people having same culture can be identified with how they percieve the environment around them.

Initially, anthropologists believed that culture was a product of biological evolution, and that cultural evolution depended exclusively on physical conditions. Todayâ€™s anthropologists no longer believe it is this simple. Neither culture nor biology is solely responsible for the other. They interact in very complex ways, which biological anthropologists will be studying for years to come.

The culture us characterized by few basic elements. The elements of culture are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Symbols: anything which carries a particular meaning recognized by people of same culture
    \item Language: system of symbols with which people communicate
    \item Values: culturally-defined standards that serve as broad guidelines 
    \item Beliefs: specific statements that people hold to be true
    \item Norms: rules and expectations by which a society guides the behavior of its members
\end{itemize}

After having fair idea on what is culture, we can now move on the national culture.

We can see from the last subsection that diverse environments promote the development of diverse cultures.
